Welcome to my online experiment!

<p><b>What it's about</b></p>
<p>The experiment is designed and developed for academic purposes by myself, Matthew White, under the supervision of Dr. Jan Hausfeld. This experiment focuses on better understanding how people attribute causality to others.
 </p>

<p><b>Experiment Instructions:</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the following rounds, you will be presented with several hypothetical scenarios. In each scenario, a certain individual <i>(Agent)</i> will make a decision; and there is a certain end-result <i>(Outcome)</i>. Your task, in each round, is to answer the question: how much do you think that the <i>Agent</i> is responsible for the <i>Outcome</i> occurring? Similarly, you will then be asked to recommend a bonus or malus (negative bonus) for the <i>Agent</i>. You should allocate the bonus or malus points based upon what you think they deserve. </p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two screens in each round. On the first screen, information regarding each scenario will be presented by means of 7 information blocks. The content of these blocks is hidden, but is revealed when you move your cursor over the panel. You can choose freely which information to look at or not. On the second screen you will be asked to judge the actions from the previous screen.
</p>
<p>There is no time-limit for this task, and the experiment will continue until you have completed 32 rounds. The entire experiment should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. </p>

<p><b>Practise rounds</b></p>
<p>Each scenario will be set in one of two contexts: <i>Football</i> or <i>Business</i>.
</p>
<p>There will be a practise round for each context to help explain how to interpret the information. </p>

<p><b>Payment for participation</b></p>
<p>All participants will be entered into a lottery, from which 5 names will be randomly selected to each with €10. Note that there are no correct or incorrect choices, we are simply interested on how you decide. Also, if drawn from the lottery, you would receive the 10 Euros irrespective of your decisions. Failure to complete the experiment, however, would exclude you from the lottery.
</p>
<p><b>Post-Experiment Question</b></p>
<p>After the completion of the experiment, you will be asked to answer a single probability question to test your statistical literacy. Please answer this question to the best of your ability.
</p>
<p><b>Personal and Contact Information </b></p>
<p>Following the experiment, you will be asked to provide some of your personal information, including your age, education, nationality, and employment type. This information will be used to account for between-subject heterogeneity, and will not be linked to you as an individual in any way.</p>
<p>You will also be asked to provide an email address by which we can contact you. Note this email address will not be linked to your answers or personal information, nor will it be provided to any external parties. Email addresses will be used exclusively to announce the winners of the lottery. Participants can also opt-in to receive a working paper of the research (upon its completion) at the provided email address. </p>
<p>
